## Awesome list criteria - Roadmap

1.  A list of **top 100 Machine Learning and Data Analysis regarding Healthcare Data** published after 2012 is suggested.
2.  If a paper is added to the list, another paper (usually from *More Papers from and before 2012" section) should be removed to keep top 100 papers. (Thus, removing papers is also important contributions as well as adding papers)
3.  Papers that are important, but failed to be included in the list, will be listed in _More than Top 100_ section.

_(Citation criteria)_

-   **< 6 months** : _New Papers_ (by discussion)
-   **2019** : +60 citations
-   **2018** : +200 citations
-   **2017** : +400 citations
-   **2016** : +600 citations
-   **2015** : +800 citations
-   **~2012** : _Old Papers_ (by discussion)
